## Back Story
This repository is aimed specifically at CSS Layouts and responsive measurements (rem, em, %, etc). I've always struggled with responsive pure CSS design so I'm trying to overcome that FEAR when doing layouts. Yeah, there are frameworks like Bootstrap which are mobile-first BUT I started looking at Bootstrap or whatever framework more than the actual core technology behind it which would not get me in the right direction. I'd use Bootstrap in a real life scenario because it saves time ( not talking only for the grid system there are so many components which save time ) so I can focus on the websites/app. Enjoy the CSS!
